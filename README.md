# Data Analytics Project

This project analyzes different student outcomes according to demographics like race, native, language, and income.  It will be using two datasets.  One data set is private set of data related to anonymous student demographics and course outcomes in an adult basic education program.  The second data set is publicly available data set of US zip code, city and county information located [here](https://www.gaslampmedia.com/download-zip-code-latitude-longitude-city-state-county-csv/).   It will demonstrate a variety of SQL queries including WHERE, GROUP BY, HAVING, CASE, JOIN, WITH AS.  

* [Creating the Data Table Queries](https://github.com/TheMrLively/da_portfolio/tree/master/Create_Table)
* [Age and Gender Queries](https://github.com/TheMrLively/da_portfolio/tree/master/Age_Gender)
* [Race and Native Language Queries](https://github.com/TheMrlively/da_portfolio/tree/master/Race_Language)

These queries will be the basis for further in analysis in Excel and Tableau.
